            <ol type="I">
                <li>Preheat a deep fryer, dutch oven, or large pot with 3 inches of oil to 325°F.</li>
                <li>Cut potatoes lengthwise into about 1/2 inch sticks.</li>
                <li>Place cut fries into a large bowl of cold water until ready to fry.</li>
                <li>Take the fries out of the water in batches and dry off the excess moisture with a clean kitchen towel. </li>
                <li>CAREFULLY place them into the hot oil and cook for 10-12 minutes. Stir them around in the oil a few times. There should not be a lot of color on the fries at this point. You will need to fry in batches.</li>
                <li>Shake off excess oil and dump fries out onto a wire rack that is sitting on a large baking sheet to catch any drips.</li>
                <li>Turn up the heat to 375°F. Again, carefully place the fries back into the fryer in batches. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the exterior is golden brown and crispy.</li>
                <li>Shake off excess oil and dump them back onto the wire rack. Immediately season with season salt and kosher salt to your taste. Enjoy</li>
