        <p> <u>The national flag of India, colloquially called the tricolour,
             is a horizontal rectangular<big> tricolour flag, </u>the<em> colours <h1> of India saffron,</h1>
              white and India green;</em> with the Ashoka Chakra, a 24-spoke wheel, in navy blue at its centre.
               It was adopted in its present form during<em> a <strong>of the Constituent Assembly held
               on 22 July 1947, and it became the official flag of the Dominion</big> of India on 15 August 1947.
                The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of</strong> India. In India, the term
                 "tricolour" almost <small> always refers to the <mark>Indian national flag. The flag is</em> based on the
                     Swaraj flag, a flag of the Indian National</small> Congress designed by Pingali</mark> Venkayya.</p>
